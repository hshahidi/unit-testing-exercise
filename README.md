# Unit Testing and TDD Exercise: Wafer Lot Average 
Getting started: 
- Clone the repo onto your local computer. 
- Make sure to `pip install pytest`  into your current environment before running the test files, this will allow for the PyTest library to be imported.
- To run the test files execute `pytest <filename>`

To Do:
- `YieldAverage.py` contains functions sum, count, and average. You can edit and modify the functions as you like, the sum function has already been modified to support all the test cases in `TestYieldSum.py`
- Following the example of test cases in `TestYieldSum.py`, build the test cases with the given wafer lots and test functions for `TestYieldCount.py` and `TestYieldAverage.py`
